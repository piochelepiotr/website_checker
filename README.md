# Website checker

## How to use the program

* launch main.py and enter commands (start by entering "help")
* if you want to launch the test, launch test_alert.py

## What I would improve

* add a completion for the commands with tab
* use keyboards arrows to execute the last commands
* add a code that checks if the url of the website is valid to help the user : for the moment, you need to enter http://www.
* add a code to remove unused memory
